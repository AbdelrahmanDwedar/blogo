## Coding Guidelines

### Go Style Guide

Follow the official [Go Code Review Comments](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/CodeReviewComments)

**Key points:**

- Use `gofmt` for formatting
- Follow Go naming conventions
- Write meaningful comments
- Keep functions focused and small
- Handle errors appropriately
- Use meaningful variable names

```

See [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md) for detailed architecture documentation.

### Best Practices

1. **Error Handling**
   ```go
   if err != nil {
       return fmt.Errorf("descriptive message: %w", err)
   }
   ```

2. **Context Usage**
   ```go
   func (s *Service) DoSomething(ctx context.Context) error {
       // Use context for cancellation and timeouts
   }
   ```

3. **Database Operations**
   - Always use parameterized queries
   - Lock appropriately (RLock for reads, Lock for writes)
   - Close rows/statements after use

4. **API Responses**
   ```go
   respondWithJSON(w, http.StatusOK, data)
   respondWithError(w, http.StatusBadRequest, "message")
   ```

## Testing

### Writing Tests

```go
func TestSomething(t *testing.T) {
    // Setup
    // Execute
    // Assert
    // Cleanup
}
```

### Running Tests

```bash
make test
# or
go test -v ./...
```
